# Theme
The theme is a crucial aspect of any app as it is the first thing that the user sees. In Maven, the app has one look across all platforms, making it easier to manage. However, this also means that it may not have the native feel of each platform. To strike a balance between a consistent look and native feel, Maven utilizes a mix of Material, Cupertino, Fluent, and other design systems to provide the best user experience.
