## Template
A template consists of exercises that you plan to perform during a workout. By preparing timers, sets, reps, and other variables in advance, you can save time during your workout and focus more on exercising.

## Program
A program is a collection of templates that are generated and stored in weekly folders. It allows you to create several templates in advance, with features such as increasing exercise weights. Additionally, you can keep track of which templates you have completed, which is not possible with regular templates.
