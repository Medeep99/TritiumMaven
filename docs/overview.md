## Mission
**Maven** was originally created as a personal project due to dissatisfaction with existing workout tracking apps that lacked certain features. These apps seemed to prioritize financial gain over user satisfaction. In response, I established an open source project where anyone can contribute and collaborate to enhance the app's functionality and ensure it remains focused on the user's needs.


## Features
While Maven may not provide any groundbreaking or revolutionary features, our aim is to enhance the fundamental aspects of workout tracking. Core features include monitoring your exercises with sets, reps, and RPE. We also help you keep track of the available equipment and track your goals, so you can stay on top of your game.

## Usage
If you've used other workout tracking apps in the past, the Maven experience should feel familiar and intuitive. However, for those who are new to the world of tracking their workouts, we've developed a comprehensive usage guide to help get you up to speed.
